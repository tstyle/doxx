ROADMAP:

High Priority
  [ ] Travis testing of package builds
  [ ] mechanism for new package build requests/submissions

Medium Priority
  -- pre-build and post-build script execution support (task runner)
  -- create an approach that permits users to distribute their packages on their own GH repos similar to Package Repo
  -- ? create a settings file so users can create their own shortcode specs
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?
  
Maybe?
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  -- summary: view a summary of key or template file in the terminal
  -- user defined open and close delimiters for templates
  -- user settings file
